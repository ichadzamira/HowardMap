PHASE 1


In Phase 1 I looked to create a basic map using the Euclidean Graph and Dijkstra algorithm. 
The main objective was to find points of interest such as buildings, street and sidewalk intersections 
and other points of interest. I would then mark all of the points of interest and the would serve as my nodes in the graph. 
The distance from one point to the next served as the edge. This was the main premise of the graph concept. 
The Dijkstra algorithm was to find the path between two points of interest. The algorithm purpose was to be able to 
find the shortest route between two points. Those points would come from the graph
